# Sort-values-in-js
Created a very simple project where you put any value and the system sorts them

I created this project just because I wanna train my Javascript skills, and creating a sort function is good for that.
You can put any value in the input type and the system sorts them but puts strings above and numbers below.

I know JS has a function to do this (sort()), but for the numbers I created it myself, and I wanna save it here.

**Important concepts covered in this project:**
document.querySelector();

document.createElement();

element.appendChild();

element.insertBefore();

element.addEventListener('', () => {});
